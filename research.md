# Watersheds are central to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Environmental Systems Science (ESS) mission

<p>
Water resources are critically important for energy production, drinking water, agriculture, and ecosystem health, but they are under increasing pressure from growing demand, land-use change, and Earth system change. Watershed-focused Science Focus Area (SFA) projects within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Environmental Systems Science (ESS) program are advancing a robust, predictive understanding of how watersheds function and respond to perturbations as integrated hydro-biogeochemical systems. 
</p>

<p>
By tightly integrating observations, experiments, and modeling, ESS advances systems-level understanding of how watersheds function and translates that understanding into advanced science-based models of watershed systems. The <strong>IDEAS–Watersheds</strong> project enables scientific software development by building new applications from reusable, robust, and scalable software components and libraries, using the best available software development practices and tools.
