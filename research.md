IDEAS-Watershed is organized around six Research Activities to address important scientific challenges and advance software development methodologies and engagement in the growing community-driven software ecosystem.

# Three Partnership Activities with ESS’s interdisciplinary SFAs 
The three Partnership Activities, each undertaken jointly with one of ESS’s interdisciplinary Science Focus Areas (SFAs) (LBNL, ORNL, PNNL), addresses biogeochemical cycling in streams across a wide range of stream orders in disparate climates and land-use conditions, from

- **LBNL Watershed Function SFA: East River Use Case** – a pristine mountainous headwater catchment
- **ORNL Critical Interfaces SFA: East Fork Poplar Creek Use Case** – a fourth-order mercury-contaminated stream in deciduous broadleaf forest in a semitropical humid climate
- **PNNL River Corridor SFA: Columbia River Use Case** – to a heavily managed ninth-order river.

The three regional SFAs share a long-term objective of elucidating how surface water/groundwater exchanges across a range of temporal and spatial scales control watershed-scale biogeochemical cycling.

Common near-term modeling activities for the interdisciplinary SFAs focus on

- surface water and groundwater exchange in watershed headwaters and stream/river corridors,
- how biogeochemical processes in spatially limited metabolically active zones interact with steady and unsteady hyporheic exchange flows to control reach-to-watershed-scale export of nutrients and inorganic contaminants, and
- developing multiscale strategies that allow coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to be represented at their native scales but expressed at watershed scale, rather than the current status of hydrologic modeling at large scale and biogeochemical modeling at smaller scales.

# CONUS Activity
Simulating integrated flow over continental scales at so-called hyper-resolution is an identified grand challenge in computational hydrology.  To adequately capture feedback between deeper subsurface flow, the land energy budget, and the lower atmosphere, explicit connections need to be made between these systems in large-scale models. The IDEAS-Watersheds CONUS Activity supports the development of an integrated hydrologic modeling platform of CONUS using ParFlow-CLM. The CONUS model, shown in the map of CONUS 2.0, bridges across our study areas and provides a scaling framework from the reach scale up to watershed and regional systems.

# Reaction Network Activity
Each of the SFAs has a well-defined scope such that they contribute uniquely to the ecosystem and community without duplicating efforts. Collaborations with other IDEAS Research Activities and partnerships will be fostered when shared interests are identified. For example, the ANL SFA shares the same interests with the PNNL SFA in generating reaction networks using KBase tools. This new connection to KBase highlights our growing collaboration with DOE-BER user facilities (EMSL), the knowledge base (KBase), and data archives and services (ESS-DIVE), to accelerate development of new reaction network models.  The collaboration activities will focus on two major aspects: (1) develop new approaches and workflows to incorporate new data and knowledge into the reaction models, including the derivation of reaction networks from metagenomics data and reaction parameters; and (2) implement reaction models that reflect the new understanding needed in the code CrunchFlow.

# Shared Infrastructure Activity
Shared computational infrastructure needs include workflow tools for transferring information across scales, customized meshing, and model-data integration, and interfaces to couple multiple process-based codes and support code interoperability.
