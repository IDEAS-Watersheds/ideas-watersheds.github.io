# Project Structure and Approach

Although the modeling strategies adopted by various activities within SBR differ in important details, they share significant modeling challenges and infrastructure needs. Shared computational infrastructure needs include workflow tools for transferring information across scales, customized meshing, and model-data integration, and interfaces to couple multiple process-based codes and support code interoperability.

The IDEAS-Watersheds Shared Infrastructure Activity will coordinate the development of the shared infrastructure by creating and advancing existing multiscale workflow tools and software interfaces to support interoperability.

The Shared Infrastructure can be shared among the SFAs to support those multi-scale models and reduce duplication of effort and ensure long-term sustainability of the capability.

*Image: Example relationship of modeling domains across scales: the multiscale workflow activity will enable model output to be used to drive boundary conditions of models at finer scales. Workflows will also be developed to work with model input data in native formats and scales, and map it to the desired computational mesh. Particle-based methods are being advanced to analyze scaling relationships and identify potential strategies for bridging fine-scale mechanistic models and understanding to larger scales.*
