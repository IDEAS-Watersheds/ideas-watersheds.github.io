Simulating integrated flow over continental scales at so-called hyper-resolution is an identified grand challenge in computational hydrology ([Wood, Roundy et al. 2011, Bierkens, Bell et al. 2015][Woody]). To adequately capture feedback between deeper subsurface flow, the land energy budget, and the lower atmosphere, explicit connections need to be made between these systems in large-scale models. Explicitly simulating these interactions is computationally expensive and therefore often simplified (either in process or resolution) in continental and global modeling approaches.

The IDEAS-Watersheds CONUS Activity will address this gap by supporting the development of an integrated hydrologic modeling platform of CONUS using ParFlow-CLM. The CONUS model, shown in the map of CONUS 2.0, bridges across our study areas and provides a scaling framework from the reach scale up to watershed and regional systems.

The CONUS Activity works to advance a continental-scale simulation platform that can bridge between individual sites and provide larger-scale context across the SFAs to provide an integrated modeling framework that spans the United States at a relatively high spatial resolution.

The proposed continental modeling will build from the existing CONUS model, applying a phased approach to explore multiscale, multi-physics treatments of terrestrial hydrology modeling from the bedrock into the atmosphere. The continental research proposed here falls under three categories: (1) model development, (2) software development and sustainability, and (3) continental simulations. The continental simulations will be used to evaluate the spatial scales and physical settings in which lateral groundwater flow has the largest impact on overall watershed behavior and sensitivity to stress. Additionally, we will use EcoSLIM to apply particle tracking to the hydrologic simulations and evaluate flow paths and residence times across watershed scales and under different hydrologic and management scenarios.

Current simulations are primarily designed to represent natural (i.e., predevelopment) hydrology with the exception of groundwater extractions, which have been included in several test cases. Moving forward with the new CONUS2.0 domain, additional parameterizations will be added to capture spatially distributed consumptive water use, irrigation, and groundwater pumping. Finally, in conjunction with the NWM team, we will explore the impact of different overland flow and land-surface formulations using the PF-WFR-Hydro coupling that is being developed.

*Image 1: Map of the expanded CONUS 2.0 domain developed with IDEAS-Watersheds. The box outlines the original CONUS 1.0 domain. The new domain extends to the coastlines and covers all tributary areas to the CONUS. This extent is consistent with the domain of the national water model and additionally the model grid has been setup to align with the National Water Model simulation grid to facilitate direct coupling and comparisons.*

*Image 2: Roadmap of CONUS model development. IDEAS-Watersheds CONUS Activity will expand the current five layer subsurface model with improved spatial representation of alluvial aquifer thickness, depth to bedrock, and deeper confined aquifer systems. Additionally, improved physical parameterizations of subsurface snow and land-surface/land energy processes will be explored.*
