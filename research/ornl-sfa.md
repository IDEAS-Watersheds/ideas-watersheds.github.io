Transient storage zones (TSZs) surrounding stream channels are locations where the downstream movement of water is delayed in comparison to the main channel flow. Metabolically active transient storage zones (MATSZs) are important subsets of TSZs that are responsible for a significant portion of carbon, nutrient, and trace metal processing, thus affecting stream biogeochemistry and, ultimately, downstream water quality.

The Critical Interfaces SFA at ORNL is elucidating and quantifying the role that coupled hydro-biogeochemical processes associated with MATSZs have on trace element fate and transformation in low-order freshwater stream systems, using the transport of Hg and its microbially mediated transformation to the neurotoxin methylmercury (MeHg) in East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC), Tennessee as its use case shown in the Figure.

IDEAS-Watersheds Partnership with the Critical Interfaces SFA at ORNL will develop a process-rich modeling framework that enables laboratory-scale experiments to be linked with reach-scale field observations, contributing to the over-arching strategy of a new multiscale modeling methodology ([Painter 2018][Painter]) that makes it possible to tractably represent the effects of redox zonation and other fine-scale geochemical phenomena in reach-to-watershed–scale models. The approach extends highly successful residence-time frameworks to accommodate nonlinear multicomponent reactions and transient flows. We will complete the implementation and testing of the new hyporheic zone model as a subgrid model in integrated surface/subsurface flow models represented in Amanzi-ATS and apply it to two low-order streams.

The transformation of Hg to MeHg is biologically mediated, coupled to in-stream nutrient cycling, and occurs only in anaerobic conditions in spatially limited regions. IDEAS-Watersheds will work with the Critical Interfaces SFA to address those multi-physics and multiscale modeling challenges. (Image provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.)*
