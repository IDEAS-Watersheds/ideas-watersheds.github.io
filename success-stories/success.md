## About Success Stories

IDEAS-Watersheds accelerates watershed science across the community through advances in the software ecosystem.  Specifically, these advances bring increased flexibility, improved and enhanced process representations, effective code reuse, and enable novel multiscale approaches to develop a predictive understanding of watershed function.  However, the important role that these advances in software infrastructure and workflows play in the development of these scientific results is rarely highlighted.  This series of success stories is designed to fill that gap by documenting the strategic approach taken in the development of new capabilities and the role Use Cases play to  ensure that they are designed holistically with flexibility and extensibility in mind, are fully tested and shared with the community, and are improved and enhanced overtime as more projects use it.  In addition, this series covers the critical role that best practices software development methodologies, software stewards, training, outreach and deployment strategies play in the scientific results.
