# About SFA's
IDEAS-Watersheds supports <a href="https://doesbr.org/research/sfa/">ESS's Science Focus Areas</a> (SFA). The SFA concept aligns DOE national laboratory research efforts with elements within the President’s annual budget request.  This approach is a recognition that the national laboratories are structured for conducting coordinated, team-oriented research in a manner that is distinct from, but complementary to, BER-supported research conducted via individual, single-investigator projects at other institutions such as universities or the private sector. This approach challenges the DOE national laboratories to build and sustain integrative, team-oriented research programs based on their unique scientific capabilities and administrative resources to meet the strategic goals of BER’s Environmental System Science (ESS) program. 

# Three Partnership Activities with ESS’s interdisciplinary SFAs 
IDEAS–Watersheds is organized around three partnership activities and four shared [<stong>infrastructure activities</stong>]() to address important scientific challenges and advance software development methodologies and engagement in the growing community-driven software ecosystem. Each partnership activity is undertaken jointly with one of ESS’s interdisciplinary Science Focus Area (SFA) projects at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). These activities address hydro-biogeochemical function of watersheds across a wide range of scales and over disparate climate and land-use conditions. The Shared Infrastructure activities address the sustainability of the software ecosystem through the Software Stewards’ activity, developing nationally consistent data sets in the Integrated Hydrologic Simulation Infrastructure (IHSI) activity, addressing land surface model integration with Integrated Hydrology in the Land Model Interface (LMI) activity, and training.

- [**LBNL Watershed Function SFA: East River Use Case**](/research/lbnl-sfa.md) –  The Watershed Function SFA seeks to understand how mountainous watersheds retain and release water, carbon and nutrients. The IDEAS-Watersheds Partnership with the Watershed Function SFA aims to extend existing watershed-scale modeling capabilities to incorporate process models for multicomponent reactive transport and plant-microbe-soil interactions, including the associated feedback processes on water (e.g. evapotranspiration) carbon and nutrient fluxes. These capabilities include both the software tools and workflows required to enable this framework.
- [**ORNL Watershed Dynamics and Evolution (WaDE)  SFA**](/research/ornl-sfa.md) – The IDEAS-Watersheds Partnership with ORNL’s WaDE SFA is advancing multiscale modeling approaches for understanding watershed hydro-biogeochemical dynamics under a range of hydrologic regimes, focusing on oxygen dynamics and metabolism in stream networks that drain heterogeneous land covers. The partnership is implementing multiscale models for stream metabolism and comparing those models to oxygen dynamics from sensor networks, and it is adding the capability to model burial, resuspension, and transport of sediment-associated solutes to the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS). This capability is of interest across the watershed-focused projects of ESS because significant transport of carbon, nutrients and trace elements occurs as suspended sediment or sorbed to suspended sediment.
- [**PNNL River Corridor SFA: Columbia River Use Case**](/research/pnnl-sfa.md) – River corridor science is conducted in the context of larger watershed processes that define boundary fluxes and exert other controls on hydrological exchange. These controls include interactions among variable river surface elevation (“stage”), hydromorphic setting, and hydrogeological heterogeneity. To determine how these processes and interactions influence river corridor hydro-biogeochemical function, models must include land-surface and groundwater processes over domains much larger than the river corridor itself. The partnership activity with the PNNL SFA aims to enable fundamental understanding of the hydro-biogeochemical function of dynamic river corridor ecosystems and translate that understanding into predictive, interoperable models across watersheds.

**Common near-term modeling activities for the interdisciplinary SFAs focus on**

- surface water and groundwater exchange in watershed headwaters and stream/river corridors,
- how biogeochemical processes in spatially limited metabolically active zones interact with steady and unsteady hyporheic exchange flows to control reach-to-watershed-scale export of nutrients and inorganic contaminants, and
- developing multiscale strategies that allow coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to be represented at their native scales but expressed at watershed scale, rather than the current status of hydrologic modeling at large scale and biogeochemical modeling at smaller scales.

<em>The three regional SFAs share a long-term objective of elucidating how surface water/groundwater exchanges across a range of temporal and spatial scales control watershed-scale biogeochemical cycling.</em>
