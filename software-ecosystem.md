# Software Ecosystem Improves Scientific Productivity

The **IDEASâ€“Watersheds** project enables scientific software development by building new applications from reusable, robust, and scalable software components and libraries, using the best available software development practices and tools. Software releases of the primary codes and primary workflow tools are managed by the Software Stewards, and are increasingly accessed through containers. 

IDEAS-Watersheds integrates standalone siloed codes into an interoperable software ecosystem using common computational libraries and frameworks to share capabilities and advance computational watershed science.

IDEAS-Watersheds team members lead development on **Primary Codes** and **Primary Workflow Tools** and integrate with *Third Party Codes* and *Third Party Workflow Tools*.
