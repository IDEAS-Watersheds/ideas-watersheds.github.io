<p> IDEAS-Watersheds integrates standalone siloed codes into an interoperable software ecosystem using common computational libraries and frameworks to share capabilities and advance computational watershed science. This enables scientific software development by building new applications from reusable, robust, and scalable software components and libraries, using the best available software
development practices and tools. Software releases of primary codes
and primary workflow tools are managed by software stewards and
increasingly accessed through containers.
</p><br>
<p> IDEAS-Watersheds team members are responsible for co-ordinating software development, maintenance, testing, and deployment
activities for primary <a href="/software-ecosystem/codes">simulation codes</a>
 and <a href="/software-ecosystem/workflowtools">workflow tools</a>. This activity
is critical to the software ecosystemâ€™s sustainability and its effective use by
the broader watershed modeling community.
