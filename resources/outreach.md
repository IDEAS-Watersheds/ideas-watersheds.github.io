The IDEAS-Watersheds project (co-)organizes a variety of workshops and trainings, and presents at events of interest to the community. Details on individual presentations at these events are included in our [publications page](/publications).

# Upcoming Activities

* ParFlow short course coming at ModFlow
* EES PI Meeting April 16-17, 2024
* **Stay tuned, more to follow soon.** 

# Current and Ongoing Activities

### Best Practices Seminars

The IDEAS-Watersheds project hosts a variey of concurrent series each month. These include:

* [Plenary Series](plenary.md) featuring our Nation’s watershed science with the aim of furthering a robust, predictive understanding of how watersheds function and respond to perturbations as hydrobiogeochemical systems
* [Modeling Case Studies](seminars.md) raise awareness of the challenges and approaches to process-based modeling, sharing our experiences and stimulating new collaborations on synergistic topics across the project.
* [Software Best Pactices](seminars.md) cover topics relevant to both workflow tools and simulation codes including, version control, continuous integration and testing, parallel debugging and visualization.
* Office Hours are an informal meeting with Software Stewards to address questions about the simulation codes and workflows that are supported under IDEAS-Watersheds

  Community Tools, a talk at Princeton’s High Meadows Environmental
  Institute, 
  [https://youtu.be/R5cokxumg9U](https://youtu.be/R5cokxumg9U), 
  Reed Maxwell, May 4, 2021.
* Water Beneath our Feet, a talk on groundwater in University of
  Arizona College of Science lecture series,
  [https://youtu.be/-70OZRRDTfQ](https://youtu.be/-70OZRRDTfQ), 
  Laura Condon, April 22, 2021.

* Continuous Improvement of Software Engineering, briefing to USGS
  Integrated Modeling and Prediction on Research Software Engineering,
  February 26, 2021.

  community-driven software ecosystem, Interagency Coastal IHTM
  Working Group, February 16, 2021.

* Darcy Lecturer, Reed Maxwell (2020): The Henry Darcy Distinguished
  Lecture Series in Groundwater Science chooses one outstanding
  groundwater professional to share their work both nationally and
  internationally on a year-long lecture tour. His talks highlight the
  CONUS model development and the challenges and opportunities of
  computational hydrology.  This has been an amazing opportunity to
  highlight some of the work of the IDEAS project and to bring
  attention to all of the work happening at the intersection of
  hydrology and computer science.
