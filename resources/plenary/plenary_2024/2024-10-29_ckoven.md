**ABSTRACT**

Disturbance is a critical component of global change, driving impacts, forcings, and feedbacks globally, but has been poorly represented in Earth system models historically. I’ll give a brief background on the FATES model, which is a vegetation demography model for use in Earth system models such as E3SM, that is focused on the representation of disturbance and its legacies. I’ll talk about the goals of the model, its rationale, how FATES differs from the current default ELM vegetation model, how we have designed the model, and some science results using different FATES configurations.
