**ABSTRACT**

Use of numerical simulation is increasingly important in the geosciences as the types and complexities of data streams and speed of computational capabilities evolve. Enhancing model literacy is critical for advancing fields of low-temperature geochemistry, hydrology and surface processes that encompass Critical Zone science, yet educational opportunities for students are often limited to platform specific workshops or only available at the advanced stages of a university degree.  While the principles of mass, momentum and energy balance are fundamental to introductory Earth Science concepts and courses; the basics of numerical simulation are often not included in most geoscience curricula leaving a knowledge and experience gap that has proven challenging to fill.  With funding through an NSF-Research Coordination Network Grant, we developed a set of specific abilities with instructional materials and exercises that allow individuals to explicitly practice and assess these abilities.  We find that by naming and defining skills like risk taking, abstraction, and deliberate communication students are overcoming barriers in model design and troubleshooting to gain confidence as modelers.
