**ABSTRACT**

Integrated hydrologic models are unique in their ability to capture spatially explicit water quantity predictions at high resolution without calibration. Frequently used for understanding annual to decadal scale water cycle questions, these models also have much to offer for short time-scale storm events under scenarios such as changing land use and water infrastructure. Presenting work from the DOE’s Urban Integrated Field Laboratory in Southeast Texas, I show how the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) is being augmented with infrastructure representations and driven by ensembles of storms to characterize flooding statistics in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area, then downscaled to meter-scale resolution and evaluated with a network of water level sensors. In addition to the hydrologic modeling work, I will present a broader framework for characterizing changing precipitation patterns, changing land use and impervious cover, and changing flood mitigation infrastructure. The resulting framework provides a strategy for providing scenario-driven evaluation of infrastructure design and is being used to inform community prioritization around flood mitigation.
