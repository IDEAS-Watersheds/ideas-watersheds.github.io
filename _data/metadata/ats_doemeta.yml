description: "The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (formerly sometimes known as the\
  \ Arctic Terrestrial Simulator) is a code for solving ecosystem-based, integrated,\
  \ distributed hydrology.  Capabilities are largely based on solving various forms\
  \ of Richards equation coupled to a surface flow equation, along with the needed\
  \ sources and sinks for ecosystem and climate models. This can (but need not) include\
  \ thermal processes (especially ice for frozen soils), evapo-transpiration, albedo-driven\
  \ surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant dynamics, deformation, transport,\
  \ and much more.\n\nPreferred citation (including correct author order):\nEthan\
