description: "PFLOTRAN is a GNU LGPL licensed code that simulates single phase water\
  \ and multiphase (air, co2, water) flow, energy transport, geochemical reaction\
  \ and biological reaction in the earth's subsurface environment. The problem may\
  \ be discretized on structured and unstructured grids. The code is designed to run\
  \ in parallel on supercomputers and leverages the open source PETSc library for\
  \ solvers and data structures and open source HDF5 for binary file I/O. See www.pflotran.org\
  \ and/or doc-dev.pflotran.org for further information. SAND2020-12161 M\n\nSandia\
  \ National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National\
  \ Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of\
  \ Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Nuclear\
  \ Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525."
