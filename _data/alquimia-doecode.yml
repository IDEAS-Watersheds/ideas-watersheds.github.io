description: "Alquimia provides a generic interface between flow and transport simulators\
  \ (drivers) and biogeochemical reaction capabilities (engines). Alquimia consists\
  \ of two parts: an application programming interface, API, and a wrapper library.\
  \ The API describes in detail how information is exchanged between the driver and\
  \ the engine. This includes the function call signatures and data structures required\
  \ for implementing alquimia in a mixed language (C/C++/Fortran) programming environment.\
  \ The library is an implementation of the documented API, providing an interface\
  \ into the biogeochemistry routines supplied by other codes: Alquimia does not do\
  \ any geochemical calculations. Version 1.0 provides interfaces to the open source\
  \ codes (BSD) CrunchFlow/CrunchTope and (LGPL) PFLOTRAN. Version 1.0 meets the policies\
  \ set forth by (and is part of) the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development\
  \ Kit, xSDK version 0.6.0."
