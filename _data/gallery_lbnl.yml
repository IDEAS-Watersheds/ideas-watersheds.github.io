      alt: East River Watershed
      description: Digital elevation map of the East River Watershed at 0.5 m resolution zooming into a subsystem comprising hillslopes and the floodplain, and further into a 2-meander subsection within the floodplain.

      alt: Variable-resolution unstructured mesh for the East River watershed
      description: Variable-resolution unstructured mesh for the East River watershed with refinement along stream corridors and in the Lower Triangle Region produced using IDEAS-Watersheds shared infrastructure. PriorityFlow was used for topographic processing, a wavelet-based method was applied to flow metrics to guide the refinement, and LaGriT-based TINerator was used to generate the final computational mesh.

      alt: Simulated surface water depth in the East River watershed 
      description: Simulated surface water depth in the East River watershed with the variable resolution mesh above (spin-up results) (Ã–zgen-Xian et al., in progress) using the ATS simulator, supported as part of the IDEAS Watersheds software ecosystem, which includes integrated hydrology but also reactive transport capabilities (Xu et al, in preparation).
