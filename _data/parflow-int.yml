description: "ParFlow is an open-source, modular, parallel watershed flow model. It
  includes fully-integrated overland flow, the ability to simulate complex topography,
  geology and heterogeneity and coupled land-surface processes including the land-energy
  budget, biogeochemistry and snow (via CLM). It is multi-platform and runs with
  a common I/O structure from laptop to supercomputer. ParFlow is the result of
  a long, multi-institutional development history and is now a collaborative effort
  between CSM, LLNL, UniBonn and UCB. ParFlow has been coupled to the mesoscale,
  meteorological code ARPS and the NCAR code WRF."

capabilities_provided: "e.g., PFLOTRAN is a Subsurface Flow and Reactive Transport Code"
capabilities_shared: "e.g., PFLOTRAN shares geochemistry, ParFlow shares PF-CLM"
capabilities_used: "e.g., ATS uses PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow Geochemistry through Alquimia"
