description: "A flexible and extensible flow and reactive transport
  simulation capability for environmental applications.  It includes
  general polyhedral mesh infrastructure, provides advanced nonlinear
  solvers, such as Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration (NKA) and Anderson
  Acceleration, and leverages Trilinos-ML and Hypre Algebraic
  Multigrid for scalable solvers.  The multiphysics framework, Arcos,
  provides a flexibility for hierarchical weak and strong coupling of
  processes with subcycling.  Geochemistry support is provided through
  the Alquimia interface library and can use the geochemistry engine
  from PFLOTRAN or CrunchFlow. The code is parallel and leverages
  Trilinos and PETSc.  Amanzi is used to model contaminant migration
  at various DOE waste sites (e.g., Hanford, and Savannah River), and
  is generally applicable to groundwater contaminant migration under
  partially saturated, nonisothermal conditions and its interaction
  with surface water.  Amanzi is jointly developed by LANL, LBNL, and
  PNNL, and ORNL as an open source project under the three-clause BSD
  license"

capabilities_provided: "e.g., PFLOTRAN is a Subsurface Flow and Reactive Transport Code"
capabilities_shared: "e.g., PFLOTRAN shares geochemistry, ParFlow shares PF-CLM"
capabilities_used: "e.g., ATS uses PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow Geochemistry through Alquimia"
