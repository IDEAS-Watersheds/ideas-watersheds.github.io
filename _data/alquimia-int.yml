description: "Alquimia provides a generic interface between flow and
  transport simulators (drivers) and biogeochemical reaction
  capabilities (engines). Alquimia consists of two parts: an
  application programming interface, API, and a wrapper library. The
  API describes in detail how information is exchanged between the
  driver and the engine. This includes the function call signatures
  and data structures required for implementing alquimia in a mixed
  language (C/C++/Fortran) programming environment. The library is an
  implementation of the documented API, providing an interface into
  the biogeochemistry routines supplied by other codes: Alquimia does
  not do any geochemical calculations. Version 1.0 provides interfaces
  to the open source codes (BSD) CrunchFlow/CrunchTope and (LGPL)
  PFLOTRAN. Version 1.0 meets the policies set forth by (and is part
  of) the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit, xSDK
  version 0.6.0."

capabilities_provided: "Alquimia is a interface library for geochemistry engines."
capabilities_shared: "Alquimia provides the interface for subsurfce and integrated surface/subsurface codes to use geochemistry engines from other codes including PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow."  
capabilities_used: "e.g., ATS uses PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow Geochemistry through Alquimia"
examples: "Eye Candy (images) with captions"

ideas_role: "Alquimia is a interface library for geochemistry engines.  Within the IDEAS-Watersheds software ecosystem integrated hydrology codes (ATS, ParFlow) and subsurface flow and reactive transport codes (Amanzi) use Alquimia to access the PFLOTRAN and Crunchflow geochemistry engines."
