description: An open-source, state-of-the-art massively parallel
  subsurface flow and reactive transport code. PFLOTRAN solves a system
  of generally nonlinear partial differential equations describing
  multiphase, multicomponent, and multiscale reactive flow and transport
  in porous materials. The code is designed to run on massively parallel
  computing architectures as well as workstations and laptops. PFLOTRAN
  is written in object-oriented, free-formatted FORTRAN 2003. The
  reactive transport equations can be solved using either a fully
  implicit Newton-Raphson algorithm or the less robust
  operator-splitting method. Geochemical capabilities include aqueous
  complexation, sorption, mineral precipitation and dissolution, and
  microbially mediated reactions.
