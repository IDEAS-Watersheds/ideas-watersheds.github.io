description: "An open-source software package for simulating reactive
  flow and transport applied to a variety of problems in the Earth and
  environmental sciences that can include an arbitrary number of
  reactions, including mineral dissolution/precipitation, ion
  exchange, surface complexation, and microbially mediated reactions
  (Steefel et al, 2015).  The code is based on a finite volume
  discretization of the governing coupled partial differential
  equations that link flow, solute transport, and multi-component
  equilibrium and kinetic reactions in porous and/or fluid media.  Two
  approaches are available at runtime for coupling reactions and
  transport: (1) a global-implicit approach that solves transport and
  reactions simultaneously, and (2) an operator-splitting approach
  based on a sequential non-iterative solve. CrunchFlow/CrunchTope is
  the recipient of an R&D 100 Award for Cutting-Edge Technologies in
  2017."
