software_title: "Amanzi 1.x"
description: "Amanzi provides a flexible and extensible multiphase, multicomponent,\
  \ flow and reactive transport simulation capability for environmental applications.\
  \ It also includes thermal and geomechanical processes in the subsurface. It includes\
  \ toolsets for meshing infrastructure, discretizations, and solvers for the resulting\
  \ nonlinear systems of equations. The framework Arcos (LA-CC-14-053), provides the\
  \ internal data management, process and coupling interfaces, and runtime configuration\
  \ through a directed acyclic graph [1]. The code is parallel and makes use of open-source\
  \ parallel frameworks such as Trilinos [2] developed at Sandia National Laboratory\
  \ and PETSc (the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing) [3] developed\
  \ at Argonne National Laboratory. Rudimentary geochemistry capabilities are included\
  \ in Amanzi, while a state-of-the-art geochemistry support is provided through the\
  \ Alquimia interface library, which can use well established open-source geochemistry\
  \ engines (e.g., PFLOTRAN or CrunchFlow). In addition, support for GPUs is being\
  \ developed through the Kokkos [4] performance portability library. Amanzi is used\
  \ to model contaminant migration at various DOE waste sites (e.g., Hanford, and\
  \ Savannah River), and is generally applicable to contaminant migration in groundwater\
  \ under partially saturated nonisothermal conditions and its interaction with surface\
  \ water. Development of Amanzi is funded by the DOE Office of Science, primarily\
  \ through programs in the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER)\
  \ and internally through LDRD. [1] Coon, E. T., J. D. Moulton, and S. L. Painter,\
