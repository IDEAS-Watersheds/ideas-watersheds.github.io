#### ParFlow [<i class="fas fa-book"></i>](https://parflow.org/) [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/parflow/parflow)

The integrated watershed model, solves saturated and variably saturated flow in three dimensions using either an orthogonal (Jones & Woodward, 2001; Kollet & Maxwell, 2006) or a terrain-following, semi-structured mesh that enables fine vertical resolution near the land surface and deep (~1 km) confined and unconfined aquifers. ParFlow models dynamic surface and subsurface flow solving the simplified shallow water equations implicitly coupled to Richardsâ€™ equation; this allows for two-way exchanges and intermittency in stream and river flow (Kollet & Maxwell, 2006). ParFlow uses robust linear (Ashby & Falgout, 1996) and nonlinear (Jones & Woodward, 2001; Osei-Kuffuor et al., 2014) solution techniques and exhibits efficient parallel scaling to large processor counts, more than 450K cores (Kollet et al., 2010), enabling very large-extent simulations with fine spatial resolution.
