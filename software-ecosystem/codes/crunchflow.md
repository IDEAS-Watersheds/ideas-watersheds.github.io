#### CrunchFlow [<i class="fab fa-bitbucket"></i>](https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope-dev/wiki/Home)
An open-source software package for simulating reactive flow and transport applied to a variety of problems in the Earth and environmental sciences that can include an arbitrary number of reactions, including mineral dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange, surface complexation, and microbially mediated reactions (Steefel et al, 2015). Two approaches are available at runtime for coupling reactions and transport: (1) a global-implicit approach that solves transport and reactions simultaneously, and (2) an operator-splitting approach based on a sequential non-iterative solve.
