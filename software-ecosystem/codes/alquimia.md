#### Alquimia [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/LBL-EESA/alquimia-dev/)
A biogeochemistry Application Program Interface and wrapper library that provides unified access to biogeochemistry capabilities from mature geochemical codes, allowing any subsurface flow and transport simulator to access a range of functionality. Alquimia is not an implementation of a biogeochemistry reaction library and does not do any geochemical calculations. Currently, Alquimia provides access to the geochemical codes PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow and can be used for the simulation of aqueous complexation reactions, radioactive decay, ion exchange, surface complexation, and mineral dissolution-precipitation.
