The first ATS short course (September 1-2, 2021) was a great success, thanks to all those who presented demos and those who
participated.  Being online we were able to attract over 50 participants from countries in Asia, Europe and North America.

The content is all available online.  The ATS short course repository
[https://github.com/amanzi/ats-short-course](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-short-course)
includes all the course material, including the slides and links to the recordings of the interactive demo sessions, which are run through Jupyter notebooks in Docker container that included Watershed Workflow and ATS.
