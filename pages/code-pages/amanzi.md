#### Amanzi [<i class="fas fa-book"></i>](https://amanzi.github.io/) [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi) 
A flexible and extensible flow and reactive transport simulation capability for environmental applications.  It includes general polyhedral mesh infrastructure, provides advanced nonlinear solvers, such as Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration (NKA) and Anderson Acceleration, and leverages Trilinos-ML and Hypre Algebraic Multigrid for scalable solvers.  The multiphysics framework, Arcos, provides a flexibility for hierarchical weak and strong coupling of processes with subcycling.  Geochemistry support is provided through the Alquimia interface library and can use the geochemistry engine from PFLOTRAN or CrunchFlow. The code is parallel and  leverages Trilinos and PETSc.   Amanzi is used to model contaminant migration at various DOE waste sites (e.g., Hanford, and Savannah River), and is generally applicable to groundwater contaminant migration under partially saturated, nonisothermal conditions and its interaction with surface water.   Amanzi is jointly developed by LANL, LBNL, and PNNL, and ORNL as an open source project under the three-clause BSD license
